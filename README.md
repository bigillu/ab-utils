# ab-utils: A melange of utilities written in modern C++

## Motivation
As a C++ software engineer, I am always on the look out for new language features that can be incorporated in my day to day coding but I am often lost in the plethora of new features that the language has to offer. This resulted in the birth of `ab-utils`, which is a playground for me to exercise modern C++ techniques, best practices, new features that I come across the internet. I intend to build this repository as a storing center for all things C++ that I find relevant and useful.
